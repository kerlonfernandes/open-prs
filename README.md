## Open Personal Rasp System (not too much open)

- I'm developing a project to automate daily tasks and gather real-time data for personal use. The goal is to follow a structured workflow I'm building to achieve a functional system. This project is tailored to meet my specific needs and focuses on learning and personal development rather than being designed for general use.
